Most people give little thought to House Ghallanda; when compared to the soldiers of House Deneith and the factories of House Cannith, an alliance of innkeepers seems harmless and inconsequential. But Ghallanda&rsquo;s strength lies in charm and connections. A Ghallanda innkeeper hears many things&mdash;if you want to know what&rsquo;s really going on in a community, talk to the halfling bartender. The leaders of House Ghallanda don&rsquo;t sell information; they prefer to build friendship and deal in favors. But should a Ghallanda baron ever truly need something, they likely have a favor they can call in.</p>\r\n<p>Ghallanda has a number of &ldquo;bound businesses&rdquo;&mdash;franchises run directly by the house. The Gold Dragon Inn is such a business, with Gold Dragon Inns being found in every major city, each serving a familiar menu and providing similar services. But many Ghallanda heirs take pride in creating their own unique businesses. There are also many independent restaurants, inns, and taverns licensed by House Ghallanda. The blink dog emblem is an assurance that a locale meets Ghallanda standards of health and quality&mdash;but not every inn is run by a halfling.</p>\r\n<p>House Ghallanda&rsquo;s mandate extends beyond providing creature comforts to travelers. Every one of the house&rsquo;s enclaves&mdash;which are more numerous than those of any other dragonmarked house&mdash;is a sanctuary beyond the legal reach of any government or dragonmarked house. Baron Yoren and his daughter Chervina have greatly expanded the house&rsquo;s presence even in remote areas such as the edge of the Demon Wastes, guided by their study of the Draconic Prophecy.</p>","avatarUrl":null,"largeAvatarUrl":null,"portraitAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/7754/10/637094282117083272.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","moreDetailsUrl":"/races/14-halfling#MarkofHospitalityHalfling","isHomebrew":false,"isLegacy":false,"groupIds":[7],"type":2,"supportsSubrace":null,"subRaceShortName":"Mark of Hospitality","baseName":"Halfling","racialTraits":[{"definition":{"id":51,"definitionKey":"racial-trait:51","entityTypeId":1960452172,"displayOrder":6,"name":"Lucky","description":"<p>When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.</p>","snippet":"When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.","hideInBuilder":false,"hideInSheet":false,"activation":null,"sourceId":1,"sourcePageNumber":28,"creatureRules":[],"spellListIds":[],"featureType":1,"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":28,"sourceType":1}],"affectedFeatureDefinitionKeys":[],"isCalledOut":true,"entityType":"racial-trait","entityID":"51","entityRaceId":14,"entityRaceTypeId":1743923279,"displayConfiguration":{"RACIALTRAIT":1,"ABILITYSCORE":0,"LANGUAGE":0,"CLASSFEATURE":0},"requiredLevel":null}},{"definition":{"id":52,"definitionKey":"racial-trait:52","entityTypeId":1960452172,"displayOrder":7,"name":"Brave","description":"<p>You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.</p>","snippet":"You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.","hideInBuilder":false,"hideInSheet":false,"activation":null,"sourceId":1,"sourcePageNumber":28,"creatureRules":[],"spellListIds":[],"featureType":1,"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":28,"sourceType":1}],"affectedFeatureDefinitionKeys":[],"isCalledOut":true,"entityType":"racial-trait","entityID":"52","entityRaceId":14,"entityRaceTypeId":1743923279,"displayConfiguration":{"RACIALTRAIT":1,"ABILITYSCORE":0,"LANGUAGE":0,"CLASSFEATURE":0},"requiredLevel":null}},{"definition":{"id":53,"definitionKey":"racial-trait:53","entityTypeId":1960452172,"displayOrder":8,"name":"Halfling Nimbleness","description":"<p>You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.</p>","snippet":"You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.","hideInBuilder":false,"hideInSheet":false,"activation":null,"sourceId":1,"sourcePageNumber":28,"creatureRules":[],"spellListIds":[],"featureType":1,"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":28,"sourceType":1}],"affectedFeatureDefinitionKeys":[],"isCalledOut":true,"entityType":"racial-trait","entityID":"53","entityRaceId":14,"entityRaceTypeId":1743923279,"displayConfiguration":{"RACIALTRAIT":1,"ABILITYSCORE":0,"LANGUAGE":0,"CLASSFEATURE":0},"requiredLevel":null}},{"definition":{"id":95,"definitionKey":"racial-trait:95","entityTypeId":1960452172,"displayOrder":1,"name":"Ability Score Increase","description":"<p>Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</p>","snippet":"","hideInBuilder":true,"hideInSheet":true,"activation":null,"sourceId":1,"sourcePageNumber":28,"creatureRules":[],"spellListIds":[],"featureType":1,"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":28,"sourceType":1}],"affectedFeatureDefinitionKeys":[],"isCalledOut":false,"entityType":"racial-trait","entityID":"95","entityRaceId":14,"entityRaceTypeId":1743923279,"displayConfiguration":{"RACIALTRAIT":1,"ABILITYSCORE":1,"LANGUAGE":0,"CLASSFEATURE":0},"requiredLevel":null}},{"definition":{"id":96,"definitionKey":"racial-trait:96","entityTypeId":1960452172,"displayOrder":9,"name":"Languages","description":"<p>You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling.

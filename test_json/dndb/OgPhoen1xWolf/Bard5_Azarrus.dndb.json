Wether it be for his unusual mannerisms or his wings he's always the talk of the town, and not in a good way. He's been trying to prove his worth through his singing but even that hasn't been enough. He used to try and hide his wings but that turned into a painful and unsuccessful endeavor. Now he's just trying to get by with what little he has left. He's turned more towards mischief in the recent years. Mostly just pulling harmless pranks to annoy the villagers that think so little of him. He knows his rep has been tarnished but at this point he doesn't really care. He's decided to become exactly what they say he is; an absolute nuisance. He's pretty much been banned from the local taverns after nearly burning one of them down with a firework prank gone wrong. So now he just performs on the street which means he doesn't earn nearly as much as he used to.","otherNotes":""},"traits":{"personalityTraits":"I love a good insult, even one directed at me.\nI’m a hopeless romantic, always searching for that “special someone.”","ideals":"Honesty.
